# Challenge: Rōnin Badge Test

Basic challenge completed.

Next features to implement:
- ability to play again without reloading from '/'
- multiplayer (bonus chalenge)
- possibly more ambitious HTML and/or some CSS

(Please note I worked on this challenge in [my sandbox repo](https://github.com/GabeMaker/makers-sandbox) and commited the final version directly to the forked repo)


Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following features:

- the marketeer has to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

As always you can use google your notes and everything else. This is a challenge for you and you only! And you must submit a pull request to this repo with your challenge solution (or partial solution) by 9am Monday morning.

**Rōnin BANZAI!!!!**

## Bonus 1: Multiplayer

Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other ( _yes there are two of them_ ).

## Bonus 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard

Use the _special_ rules ( _you can find them here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock_ )

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock
